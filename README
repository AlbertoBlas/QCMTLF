DOCUMENTATION
-------------

"QCMTLF" contains Flex 4.1+ projects related to the Adobe Text Layout Framework.

The library project QCMTLFLib contains common components used in examples.

There are also example projects demonstrating usage of Adobe's Text Layout
Framework including:
	ManualTLF: examples of using TLF in custom text components as opposed to
		using Flex Spark components that already utilize TLF.
	Pagination: example of implementing pagination with TLF.
	
Again, please note that most (but not all) examples require QCMTLFLib.swc.
